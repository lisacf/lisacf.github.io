# 🏷 Badge Guide for My Learning Svelte Blog

To keep posts organized and easy to scan, I use a small badge system throughout my blog.

Each badge signals a different kind of section or learning activity.

---

## 📚 Concept

- Explains a new idea (like props, state, slots, layouts)
- Plain English + simple examples
- No building yet — just understanding

---

## 🛠 Experiment

- Build a tiny, focused example to apply the concept
- Always runnable code
- Helps move from theory ➔ practice

---

## 🧪 Tiny Challenge

- A micro task for readers to try
- Reinforces active learning
- Often follows an experiment

---

## 💡 Beginner Tip

- A quick bonus explanation for jargon or tricky ideas
- Often inside a collapsible `<details>` block
- Helps beginners stay confident without breaking flow

---

## 🚀 Project Build

- When multiple concepts come together into a small project
- Could be an experiment page or real app feature
- Marks a milestone ("I built this!")

---

## 🖼 Visual Aid

- Diagrams, charts, or flow illustrations
- Makes ideas easier to understand at a glance

---

## ✨ How to Use Badges

- Start each section title with the appropriate badge.
- Keep the meaning consistent across all posts.
- Feel free to combine badges if needed (e.g., an Experiment that also includes a Tiny Challenge).
