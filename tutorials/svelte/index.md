# ✨ Welcome to My Learning Svelte Blog!

Hi there! 👋  
This blog is my personal journey as I learn Svelte and SvelteKit —  
and I’m sharing everything I figure out along the way.

---

## 🛠 What is Svelte?

**Svelte** is a modern tool for building web apps.  
It lets you write **simple components** — and then **automatically turns them into super-fast, optimized JavaScript** when you build your project.

You use Svelte to build:

- Websites
- Apps
- Games
- Interactive dashboards
- and more!

✅ It's famous for being **beginner-friendly** *and* incredibly **powerful** once you grow.

**SvelteKit** is a related tool that helps you build full apps using Svelte —  
handling things like routing, layouts, data loading, and even server-side rendering.

> 💬 **Don't worry if these terms (like "component" or "routing") sound confusing right now!**  
> I explain every piece along the way, step-by-step, with real examples.

Open up this tip to get a quick look at what we will discuss.

<summary>💡 Beginner Tip: What is a Component?</summary>

A **component** is just a **small, reusable building block** that controls part of your app’s UI (user interface).

You can think of a component like a **tiny Lego brick** —  
you stack lots of them together to build full websites and apps!

- Each component controls its own HTML, CSS, and logic.
- Components can **receive props** (information) to make them flexible.
- Components can **remember things** using **state**.

## 📚 How This Blog Works

Each post focuses on a **single concept** in Svelte — like **props**, **state**, **layouts**, or **slots**.

- I break the idea down into **plain English**, with examples that are beginner-friendly.
- Then, we **immediately test** the idea by building a **tiny experiment** in our own real SvelteKit app.

✅ We don't just *read* about concepts — we **build, test, and play** with them!  
✅ Every experiment is a small, live exercise you can follow along with in your project.

## 🛠 Why Experiments?

Learning by doing is the best way to truly understand new ideas.  
Each experiment is small on purpose — so we can **focus deeply** on one idea at a time  
before moving on to the next.
