# Getting Started with Svelte

Welcome! ðŸŽ‰ This walkthrough is built for beginners. Weâ€™ll move step-by-step through the basics of Svelte, explaining each detail along the way. If youâ€™ve done a bit of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript before, thatâ€™s greatâ€”but donâ€™t worry if youâ€™re new to some concepts. Weâ€™ll cover everything you need to know.

Before diving in here, make sure youâ€™ve:

1. Set up your code editor (see [Editor Setup](/tutorials/svelte/editor-setup.md)).

Once youâ€™re ready, letâ€™s get started!

## What Is Svelte?

Svelte is a user-interface framework that helps you build web apps with plain JavaScriptâ€”no heavy framework code sent to the browser. Instead, Svelte converts your components into efficient JavaScript during a build step.

- **No bulky runtime**: Your final app is just small, optimized JS.
- **Easy reactivity**: Assign to variables and Svelte updates the page.
- **Components**: Break your UI into self-contained, reusable pieces.

**Reactivity**, **Components**, **Runtime** Have no fear this tutorial describes these words one page at a time.  Keeping things clear and simple.

Svelte is a **Declarative** framework for web apps.

Other declarative frameworks include 
- React (for web apps)
- SwiftUI (for iOS apps)
- Flutter (for cross-platform apps)

Instead of manually updating the UI when things change, you just update the state, and the framework automatically rebuilds the correct UI based on that state.

Read what it means to be declarative in [Declarative Apps](declarative_app.md) section.
