## What Is Svelte?

Svelte is a user-interface framework that helps you build web apps with plain JavaScriptâ€”no heavy framework code sent to the browser. Instead, Svelte converts your components into efficient JavaScript during a build step.

- **No bulky runtime**: Your final app is just small, optimized JS.
- **Easy reactivity**: Assign to variables and Svelte updates the page.
- **Components**: Break your UI into self-contained, reusable pieces.

**Reactivity**, **Components**, **Runtime** Have no fear this tutorial describes these words one page at a time.  Keeping things clear and simple.

Svelte is a **Declarative** framework for web apps.

Other declarative frameworks include 
- React (for web apps)
- SwiftUI (for iOS apps)
- Flutter (for cross-platform apps)

Instead of manually updating the UI when things change, you just update the state, and the framework automatically rebuilds the correct UI based on that state.

Read what it means to be declarative in [Declarative Apps](/tutorials/svelte/declarative_app.md) section.
