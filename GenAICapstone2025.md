## ‚ú® Introduction: Bringing Magic to Word Games with Gen AI

Hi there! I'm excited to share my project for **Google's** Generative AI Intensive Course Capstone 2025Q1 ‚Äî a spellbinding word game called **SPELL**, short for **Semantic Processing Engine for Lexical Learning**. üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This project was not just about learning how to build with Google AI and LangChain ‚Äî it was also a way to bring something I love into the world of generative AI: **word games**.

I've always been a fan of word games like **Squardle**, **Perquackey**, **Boggle**, and of course, **Wordle**. There‚Äôs something so satisfying about finding hidden words, solving puzzles, and stretching your vocabulary just a little further with each round.

With SPELL, I wanted to take that world and **level it up using Gen AI**.  
What if every puzzle had a theme you picked yourself?  
What if a magical AI guide greeted you at the start, helped you when you got stuck?  
What if the words themselves adapted in difficulty, and you got to **learn vocabulary in a fun, interactive way**?

And for me, this was also a chance to **learn new tools** ‚Äî like **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and the **Gemini API** ‚Äî while exploring **Kaggle** as a coding platform. This was my first time diving into all of these, and it turned out to be an **incredibly fun and rewarding experience**. 

Not only did I build something playable, but I also got to explore how Gen AI can elevate game design, education, and creative coding.

In the rest of this post, I‚Äôll show how SPELL works, what problems it solves, and how I used Gen AI in several creative ways to bring it all to life. I hope it sparks ideas for you too.
